A class is not an object; a class is a DESIGN of an object.
An object is made by making an instance of that class; 
in other words, implementing the design of the object.

In other words,
class = blueprint
object = implementation of the blueprint

Example: 
* Snake.cs is the design of the Snake, but not an implementation of it
* In order to make a snake, you have to create a new object in some other class, for example program.cs
