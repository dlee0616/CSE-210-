A class is not an object; a class is a DESIGN of an object.
An object is made by making an instance of that class; 
in other words, implementing the design of the object.

In other words,
class = blueprint
object = implementation of the blueprint

Example: 
* Snake.cs is the design of the Snake, but not an implementation of it
* In order to make a snake, you have to create a new object in some other class, for example program.cs

* When you run into a bug, look into the details of the issue. Usually, when when 
    we examine the inner-workings of the issues, the solution becomes clear to us.

* Become PRECISE and CAREFUL in writing your code. Make sure every line is case perfect,
    indent perfect, syntax FLAWLESS.
* Nomenclature is the naming of things.
